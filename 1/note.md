# Assignment 1

## Task: 

1. **[MUST]** Given three 3D points, fill transformation matrices and then make points show on screen. 
2. **[OPTIONAL]** Rotate points around any axis through origin.

**Key words**: Transformation, rasterization. 

PPT: 3-5.

## Recall:

1. MVP transformation: Model, view, projection.
2. Derivation of rotation formula: use (r, theta).
3. View: 
   1. Camera on origin, look at -Z.
   2. Rotate around any axis. Rodrigues’ Rotation Formula.
4. Projection: orthographic(正交) projection, perspective(透视) projection.
   1. Orthographic projection: make all points in [-1,1]^3.
   2. Perspective projection: covert to orthographic projection.
      1. Near plane point's coordinate don't change, as do those on far plane.
5. Field-of-view: angle. Aspect ratio: width/height.
