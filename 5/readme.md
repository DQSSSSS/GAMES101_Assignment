# Assignment 5

## Task:

Implement Whitted-Style ray tracing.

**Key words**: Whitted-Style ray tracing 

PPT: 13

## Recall:

1. Whitted-Style ray tracing. Shooting a ray from eye across pre pixel, hitting some items multiply times, linking hit points to light sources, then computing the color on this pixel.
   1. Ray intersection with triangle. Check? Moller-Trumbore Algorithm(giving barycentric coordinate).
   2. Accelerating. Bounding Volumes. Axis-Aligned Bounding Box(AABB).

## Code:

[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
